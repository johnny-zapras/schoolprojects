# Crossword Solving Application

The following is a program which takes two files: a dictionary text file and an unsolved crossword file (such as the files titled "Sample Dictionary" and "Sample Input") and consequently writes a third text out with answers (for example, using the above two files will generate identical results to "Sample Output"). The program uses a hash table to store all pertinent information.

##To run the program:

**1.** Place all files within this project in one directory.
**2.** Compile `WordSearch.java`.
**3.** Run `WordSearch.java` while providing a dictionary text file as the first argument and an unsolved file as the second argument.

*Note: the program has been configured to only find words longer than three letters.*
