# Anagram Finding Program

The following is a program which takes two files: a dictionary text file and a list of words (such as the files titled "Sample Dictionary" and "Sample Input") and consequently writes a third text out with all possible anagrams for the latter file as dictated by the dictionary file (for example, using the above two files will generate identical results to "Sample Output"). The program uses an AVL tree (as structured in `AVLTree.java`) to store and find all pertinent data.

##To run the program:

**1.** Place all files within this project in one directory.  
**2.** Compile `FindAnagrams.java`.  
**3.** Run `FindAnagrams.java` while providing a dictionary text file as the first argument and a words list as the second argument.   

*Note: the program has been configured to so that the word checked is not printed as one of the resulting anagrams.*
